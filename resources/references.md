## Documentation

As mentioned earlier, we will be using the Mozilla Foundation's documentation as our main reference for learning JavaScript rather than the ECMAScript publication.

## Style Guide

Style guides are a set of standards on how to write and structure your code. These are followed to ensure consistency in coding conventions and that all developers have agreed upon a certain way of doing things. Below are some of the style guides as defined by various organizations.

- [JavaScript Standard Style Guide](https://github.com/standard/standard)
- [w3chool's JavaScript Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)
- [JQuery's JavaScript Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
- [Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- [Google's JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
